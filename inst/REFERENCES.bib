  abstract = {A geochemical study of thermal springs, cold springs, stream waters and natural gas emissions has been carried out in the Campania region of southern Italy. This region hosts four Quaternary volcanic areas, and thermal springs and gas emissions occur in three of them. Most thermal springs discharge Na-Cl composition waters of connate origin derived from post-erogenic volcanic and sedimentary formations. Although high-enthaIpy systems are present in two of the four volcanic areas, there appear to be no magmatic contributions to the thermal springs. Solute geothermometers are unreliable as spring waters are strongly affected by mixing with ``shallow'' brines before discharging.},

  abstract = {This paper outlines certain fundamental principles in a graphic procedure which appears to be an effective tool in segregating analytical data for critical study with respect to sources of the dissolved constituents in waters, modifications in the character of a water as it passes through an area, and related geochemical problems. The procedure is based on a multiple-trilinear diagram (Fig. 1) whose form has been evolved gradually and independently by the writer during the past several years through trial and modification of less comprehensive antecedent forms. Neither the diagram nor the procedure here described is a panacea for the easy solution of all geochemical problems. Many problems of interpretation can be answered only by intensive study of critical analytical data by other methods.},
